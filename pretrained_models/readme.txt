Constraints:
Due to file size constraints on GitHub (maximum 25MB per file), the complete set of pretrained models cannot be directly uploaded to this repository. 
The models are relatively large, with each ensemble model and its base components exceeding the GitHub upload limit.

Quick Start with Sample Models:
To demonstrate functionality and allow for immediate verification, we have included Sample pretrained models for 4mC_G.pickeringii (within file size limits).

How to Get All Models:
Run the provided scripts to train all models from the 'pretain' module.
